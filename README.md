## The Task

There are a variety of companies that offer products to consumers that give them real time data on various aspects of their health. With so much availability of health and fitness data to the everyday consumer, there is likely to be trends in what are the most important uses of smart devices. Bellabeat key stakeholders are seeking to use data regarding the current usage of smart devices across the health and fitness industry to determine what data points and uses are most important to consumers.  Lastly, the insights derived from the data across the industry and within Bellabeat will then be used to recommend how these trends can be utilized to tailor the marketing strategy.

### Cleaning the Data
An immediate limitation that was observed of the provided data is that only 8 participants logged any weight information from the weight_info dataset in comparison to the 33 participants in the daily_activity dataset. 

## Insights
What trends did I discover?
The main insight discovered is that a balance of being very active, fairly active and lightly active led to the most calories being burned.

Most users showed a larger percentage of active minutes being in the lightly active category which includes the users that burned the most calories. 

Therefore, it can be inferred that it is not necessary to be primarily in the very active category for calorie loss to be effective. 

Why does Belabeat Care?
With the summer season approaching soon, many users of fitness devices will have goals to attempt to lose weight prior to vacations and visits to the beach etc. Belabeat can focus its marketing strategies on calorie loss and the effectiveness of utilizing consistent light physical activity to burn calories. This insight may appeal to more users as light physical activity may be less daunting in comparison to high intensity training such as high intensity interval training. The effectiveness of light physical activity may also appeal to individuals that are newer to fitness and exercise. 

Less time being sedentary does provide some correlation to more calories burned but it is not an absolute indicator.

Why does Belabeat care?
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increase in the number of people working remotely. A side effect of working from home is an increase in the amount of time being sedentary. The data shows that there is some correlation to an increase in calories burned if less time is spent being sedentary however the correlation is not absolute. This is observed in the analysis as the users with the most amount of calories burned remained under the average amount of time being sedentary, however, there were some exceptions in the data. Belabeat can use this information to market to users who work in professions that tend to be sedentary in nature to emphasize being less sedentary and more active especially in keeping with the prior theme of weight loss.
